# Terminal and Editor Commands

This repo contains a collection of the most common use cases of Terminal Editor commands and Terminal Shortcuts that I have encountered till now.

- [Bash Shortcuts](bash-shortcuts.md) : These are some commonly used shortcuts that can help moving in a bash terminal easier.
- [Vim Commands](vim-commands.md) : [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) is a widely used terminal editor. It ships with most UNIX and Linux systems and is really fast. Here I have listed a number of commands that covers most of the common functionalities of the editor.
- [GCC](gcc-and-gdb.md#gcc) - The [GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/) is a compiler system produced by GNU Project. It's widely used in C/C++ projects mostly in Linux systems.
- [GDB](gcc-and-gdb.md#gdb) - The [GNU Debugger](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) is a commandline debugger that is used for debugging C/C++ code. It is also maintained by the GNU Project. It can used for remote debugging as well.
